#  Panduan Pengguna Cadasta Platform


Panduan ini diperuntukkan untuk membantu pengguna dalam menggunakan Platform Cadasta. Platform ini dirancang untuk mengumpulkan, mengatur dan menampilkan data terkait masyarakat dan komunitas, tanah termasuk sumber daya yang mereka gunakan dan hubungan antar keduanya.




An estimated 70% of land in emerging economies is undocumented. For those citizens left out of the formal land administration system there is still a need to document what rights exist, where they are and to whom they apply. Customary groups, slum dwellers associations and small municipalities, to name a few are amongst the types of organizations that would like to better document property rights, however historically the tools and technology required put that out of reach.

With the Cadasta Platform we invite users to use our open, cloud based platform to setup and manage their own rights. Our tools for data collection and management combined with our expertise in helping partners think through approaches to recording land rights ensure the Platform is easy to use for all.

Please give the platform a try and begin to document rights within your community.
