# Cadasta Platform User Guide

This guide serves to help users get started on the Cadasta Foundationâ€™s land and resource rights management system.

An estimated 70% of land in emerging economies is unregistered. For those citizens left out of the formal system their is still a need to document what rights exist, where they are and to whom they apply. Customary groups, slum dwellers associations and small municipalities, to name a few are amongst the types of organizations that would like to better document property rights, however historically the tools and technology required put that our of reach.

With the Cadasta Platform we invite users to use our open, cloud based platform to setup and manage their own communities rights. Our tools for data collection, platform for managing data and expertise in helping partners think through approaches make the Platform easy to use for all.

Please give the platform a try and begin to document the rights of those in your community.
