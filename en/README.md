# Cadasta Platform User Guide

This guide serves to help users get started on the Cadasta Foundationâ€™s land and resource rights management system.

An estimated 70% of land in emerging economies remains undocumented.  For those citizens left out of the formal system their is still a need to record what rights exist, where they are and to whom they apply.  Customary groups, slum dwellers associations and small municipalities, to name a few, are among the types of organizations that would like to better document property rights.  Unfortunately however the cost and complexity of the tools and technology required often put them out of reach.

With the Cadasta Platform we invite users to use our open, cloud based platform to setup and manage their own land and resource rights.  Our tools for data collection and management combined with our expertise in helping partners think through approaches make the Platform easy to use for all.

Please give the platform a try and begin to document the rights of those in your community. Thank you!
