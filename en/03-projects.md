### Setting Up a New Project {#setting-up-new-project}

Once you've created your organization, you can start to add projects.

#### 1. Navigate to the "Add project" button.

You can find the **Add project** button in one of two ways. The first way is from your Organization Overview page:

![](/assets/add-project-1.png)

And the second way is by clicking the **Projects** button at the top of the page, and then clicking **Add**.

#### 2. Navigate to your project location

Your project location is the geographic area where field data collection activities take place. You can find your area on the map using a couple different approaches.

##### a. Zooming from the map

![](/assets/Cadasta-Map-Overview.png)

From the map view, use the `+` and `-` signs on the upper left to zoom in and out.

In the upper right, you can choose from a couple of different layers depending on what kind of map you need.

The default layer is the graphic OpenStreetMap layer, shown above. You can also select the DigitalGlobe Satellite layer:

##### b. Search by a geographic Place Name

Click on the magnifying glass in the upper left to search for your location by name.

#### 3. Create your project area.

To create your project area, you can draw either a rectangle or a polygon.

Note that your project area does not need to be exact. To ensure full coverage, add a little bit of space outside the area where you'll be working.

**To draw a polygon**, click the polygon button. Then, start clicking points on the map to draw your shape.

![](/assets/cadasta-map-polygon.png)

You can edit your polygon by clicking the Edit Location button.

From there, you can click to add each point of your polygon to its intended location. To close the polygon, click on the first point that you added.

**To draw a rectangle**, select the rectangle icon. Then, click and drag over your project area on the map.

**To edit your project area**, select the edit icon. Then, click and drag the points on your polygon or rectangle to their correct location. When you're done, click the gray Save button on the left

Once you've drawn your project area to your satisfaction, click the green **Next** button on the right.

#### 4. Provide some general information about the project.

At this stage, you will be asked to fill out some General Information regarding the project, including:

* **Project name**

* **Project privacy preference**, or whether the project will be Public or Private. Public projects are viewable by anyone, whereas private projects are only available to your organization.

* **Project description**

* **Project URL**, which must start with _http://_.

* **Project Questionnaire**, a.k.a. the Data Collection Form. This spreadsheet becomes the basis for your data collection. To learn more about how they work and get sample forms, read our section on[data collection forms](/en/XLSForms.md)

* **Project contacts**, if any. Note that project contacts are not necessarily the same thing as project members.

If you're adding a project by navigating from the Project page, you'll also be asked to select the **Project's organization** from a dropdown menu at the top.

#### 5. Assign Project Member Permissions

When you're done adding your general information, you can assign project member permissions. Project members are members of your organization, and their permissions reflect their role in any given project.

When you're done, congratulations! You've created your very first project. 

Your next steps are to start collecting records for your projects, including:
* **project locations** - all the parcels, buildings, boundaries and other locations relevant to your project;
* **location relationships** - or parties that have some right or access to your location, and 
* **resources** like photos, deeds, and other documentation related to your project, location or location relationships. 

Read more about these records in the next section: [Project Records: Locations, Relationships, and Resources](04-records.md). 


### Project Members & Member Permissions {#project-members-member-permissions}

When you create members of your project, you must assign them permissions. These permissions will define user accesses and privileges for using the platform. Currently, there are five user roles, defined below with details regarding access rights:

* **Administrator**. The Administrator can create new projects within an organization, manages user roles and access, and has full permissions regarding accessing and editing data.

* **Project Manager**. The Project Manager works within an organization on a specific project, and with regard to that project can access and edit all data within the project, including adding new users to the project and setting access rights.

* **Data Collector**. The Data Collector works in the field with the communities to collect data using Field Papers, Mobile Applications, or by directly entering data into the platform. The Data Collector can add data in a project, but cannot edit existing data.

* **Project User**. The Project User can view all data within the project, even if it is set to private. The Project User does not have the ability to add or edit data.

* **Public User**. A Public User can view only data that is publicly available.


### Editing a Project {#editing-a-project}

Once you've created a project, you may find that you need to make some changes. There are three aspects of a project that you can change:

* Project Location
* Project Details, and
* Member Permissions. 

To change any of these aspects of your project, navigate to your project page, and then click the three dots on the upper right of your screen.

#### Editing a Project Location

Once you've navigated to the Edit Project Location page, you can use the tools on the left of the map to make your project location changes changes. 

You can either click the edit icon and drag your boundary points as needed:

> [add image]

Or you can select the polygon or rectangle tools to draw completely new boundaries. 

When you're done, click the **gray Save button** on the left to save your shape, and the **green Save button** on the right to save your project location. 

####Editing Project Details

Once you've navigated to the Project Details page, you can edit information like the name, description, questionnaire or privacy settings. When you're done, save your changes by clicking the **Save** button at the bottom of the page. 

####Editing Member Permissions

Once you've navigated to the Edit Member Permissions page, you can change your member permissions by using the drop-down menu for each member.
