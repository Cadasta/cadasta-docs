### Project Locations, Location Types, & Location Aquisition {#project-locations}

Within any given project, you may be working with lots of different locations. For example, within a forested area, there may be a national park boundary or building that you'll need to track.

#### Adding a Location {#adding-a-location}

From the main project page, select either **Add location** or **Add a location**:

On the next page, you'll be asked to draw your location on the map as a point, line, polygon, or rectangle.

Here, you'll also be asked to provide some information about your location. If you're using the [minimal questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gB7lcz4Dr6aqdW_Oesuum2pbI8lzs6EYTLpVZGQMhcQ/edit#gid=2006567796), you'll just need to indicate the type of location. 

If you're using the [standard questionnaire](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QsqMTLlPH5KVbBcgnh6MHWkIR0pIFchVzkqBSoL92fA/edit#gid=2006567796), you'll be asked to specify the following:

* [Location type](#location-types)
* Name of Location
* [Spatial Unit Quality](#spatial-unit-quality)
* [How Location was Acquired](#location-acquisition), 
* When the location was acquired, and
* Location Notes.

When you're done, save your location. 

To access this location, click on it from the main project page.

#### Location Types {#location-types}

Location types define the type of location you're uploading. The following are defined in the [standard questionnaire](assets/standard_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx):

#### Parties{#Parties}

Parties are the individuals, groups or corporations who have a stake in one of the locations in your project. 

* **Individuals** are single people, like a landowner or lessee.
* **Groups** are collections of people who may not have an official organization. 
* **Corporations** are organizations like companies, NGOs, or government bodies.  

#### Adding a New Relationship {#adding-a-new-relationship}

In the pop-up that follows, you'll be first asked to either choose from an existing party or add a new one.

If you're adding a new one, you'll need to provide:

* Party name, 
* Party type (individual, group, or corporation - meaning any kind of official organization), and

### Project & Location Resources {#project-resources}

Land rights projects can come with all kinds of documentation - like legal documents, letters, pictures and more. Some of that documentation may relate to multiple locations within a project, or to one location, or it may just relate to the project in general.

The Cadasta Platform is set up to handle this kind of complexity, organizing resources into two different types:

* Resources pertaining a specific location, and

* Resources pertaining to the project generally.


####Adding a New Resources {#adding-new-resource}

There are a couple ways to add a new resource, depending whether it pertains to a location or resource. 

If you're adding a **project location resource**, select the **Resources tab** from the location overview page, and then **Add resource.**

![](/assets/add-location-resource.png)

To add a resource that pertains to the overall project, go to the project's overview page by clicking **Overview**. Then, click **Resources.** 

![](/assets/resources-from-overview.png)

Clicking on resources from the project overview page will take you to your project library, which will have all of the resources related to your project.

![](/assets/project-library.png)

To add a resource while you're in the the library, click **Add** on the upper right.

From any of these starting points, you'll be led to a pop-up window. Here, you'll be asked to upload a file, and give it a name and description.
