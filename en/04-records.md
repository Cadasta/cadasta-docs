### Project Locations, Location Types, & Location Aquisition {#project-locations}

#### Adding a Location {#adding-a-location}

Within any given project, you may be working with lots of different locations. For example, within a forested area, there may be a national park boundary or building that you'll need to track.

Select whether your location is to be displayed as a point, line, polygon, or rectangle, and then draw it on the map.

Depending on the structure of your [questionnaire](/08-XLSForms.md), you'll be asked to add some information about your location. At the bare minimum (using the [minimal questionnaire](assets/Minimum_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx)) you'll need to indicate the type of location. Using the [standard questionnaire](assets/standard_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx), you'll be asked to specify the following:

* Location Type
* Name of Location
* Spacial Unit Quality
* How Location was Acquired, and
* Any other information about the location.

When you're done, save your location. 

To access this location, click on it from the main project page.

#### Location Types {#location-types}

Location types define the type of location you're uploading. The following are defined in the [starndard questionnaire](assets/standard_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx):

* **Parcel** - a plot of land.
* **Community Boundary** - a formal or informal boundary between two groups of people.
* **Building** - any kind of structure.
* **Apartment** - an apartment or apartment building.
* **Project Extent** - the full boundary of the project.
* **Right-of-Way** - an easement that allows a person or group of people to pass throuh another's land.
* **Utility Corridor** - a passage, either overground or underground, meant to carry utility lines like electricity and water. 
* **National Park Boundary** - the boundary between a national park and another kind of land. 
* **Miscellaneous** - another kind of location that doesn't fit into any of your categories.

To change the location types that you're using, [edit your questionnaire](08-XLSForms.md). 

### Location Relationships & Tenure Types

#### Relationships {#relationships}

Any given location has a relationship to a number of parties. For example, a municipality may own a utility corridor, which certain communities may use as a right-of-way. 

#### Adding a New Relationship {#adding-a-new-relationship}

To add a new relationship for a project location, click **Add relationship** from the main project page. 

> [add image]

In the pop-up that follows, you'll be asked to add a party. If the party hasn't already been logged, click **Add party**.

> [add image]

There, you can add the party name, party type (Individual, Group or Corporation), and any notes you have about the party.

Next, you'll be asked to add relationship details, including the tenure type and notes about the tenure. 

#### Tenure Type {#tenure-type}

**Tenure type** refers to the type of ownership or right that a party may have with regards to a location. In the Cadasta Platform, you can define a party's tenure type in a variety of ways. 

* Carbon Rights
* Concessionary Rights
* Customary Rights
* Easement
* Equitable Servitude
* Freehold
* Grazing Rights
* Hunting / Fishing / Harvest rights
* Indigneous Land Rights
* Joint Tenancy
* Leasehold

* Water Rights

To learn more about many of these terms, check out the glossary from [Focus on Land in Africa](http://www.focusonland.com/resources/glossary/#e ). 

### Project & Location Resources {#project-resources}

Each project may have many locations, and each location may have its own set of documentation or resources about it. Some of that documentation may relate to multiple locations within a project, or it may just relate to the project itself. 

The Cadasta Platform is set up to handle this complexity. As a result, resources like photos, letters, deeds, or anything else related to your project can be organized as you need. 

####Adding a New Resources {#adding-new-resource}

There are a few ways to add a new resource, as resources can be assigned to a few different aspects of a project:

* a project location
* a location relationship, and
* the project in general.  

If you're adding a resource related to a specific project location, select the **Resources tab** from the location overview page, and then **Add new resource.**

> Add image

To add a resource related to a relationship, navigate to the **Relationships tab** and click on the party that the documenation relates to. From there, you can click the **Add** button. 

> Add image

To add a resource that's mainly for the project overall, go to the project's overview page by clicking **Overview**.

> Add image

Then, click **Resources.** Clicking on resources from the project overview page will take you to your project library, which will have all of the resources related to your project.

> Add image

From the library, click **Add**. 

> Add image

From any of these starting points, you 'll be led to a pop-up window. Here, you'll be asked to upload a file, and give it a name and description. 

> Add image

Acceptable file types include:

* .pdf
* .mp3
* .mp4
* .doc
* .docx
* .jpg

Resources will be connected to relationships and locations depending on where they're uploaded from.
