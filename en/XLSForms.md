# Custom Data Collection

The Cadasta platform allows partners to define their own data collection schema, as we know that data needs vary with the context.  Our platform structures the data around three core attributes: the right holder, the location and the relationship between the two.

In order to define the data collection parameters of your organization, we utilize XLSForm as an easy way to set how the data is collected, managed and queried.  XLSForm is a form standard based on authoring forms using a spreadsheet.  The forms are easy to use, while also allowing more complex forms and dependencies for those more familiar with XLSForms.

For more information on XLSForms and details on how to get started, visit XLSForm.org

We have also provided a "starter" form that is the basis for man of our programs, and which can [be accessed here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QsqMTLlPH5KVbBcgnh6MHWkIR0pIFchVzkqBSoL92fA/edit?usp=sharing).

Stay tuned as we will be adding additional generic forms in the near future.
