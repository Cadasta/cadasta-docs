# Geographical Open Data Kit \(GeoODK\) Collect User Guide

In addition to ODK Collect, it is also possible to collect data using the GeoODK application for Android devices (unfortunately not available yet for Apple devices). To get started, please [download GeoODK Collect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geoodk.collect.android) from the Google Play Store, or wherever you acquire your applications.

## **Initial Setup**

If this is the first time you have used GeoODK with the Cadasta Platform, you will need to configure GeoODK for direct syncing with the  Platform. In order to do this, you will first need to setup your Cadasta account if you haven't already \(see Getting Started\).

1. Once you have installed GeoODK, please open the application.
2. Select **Settings** from the home page using the menu key.

5. Please also enter the Username and Password utilized with the Cadasta platform

6. Select the Back button three times to return to the GeoODK Main Menu.

Now GeoODK is configured for data collection that will feed directly to the Cadasta Platform.
