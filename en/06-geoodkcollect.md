###Overview {#overview}

Geographical Open Data Kit \(GeoODK\) is a data collection application for Android devices (unfortunately not yet available for Apple devices). Like ODK Collect, GeoODK can be used for data collection for projects in the Cadasta Platform. 

This section provides an overview of how GeoODK works with the Cadasta Platform. 

1. First, you'll [set up GeoODK](#initial-setup) on an Android device.
2. Then you'll [load the questionnaire](#loading-your-form) you want to use for data collection.
3. Finally, it's time to [collect your data](#data-collection)! 
4. When you're back to WiFi, [upload your data](#upload-data) to the Cadasta Platform.

**Important!** Steps 1, 2, and 4 require being near WiFi. You may also want to test step 3 before heading out into the field, just in case you need to make any changes. 

For more information and documentation about GeoODK generally, visit [geoodk.com](http://geoodk.com/).

### Initial Setup {#initial-setup}

To get started, [download GeoODK Collect from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geoodk.collect.android) or wherever you acquire your applications.

If this is the first time you've used GeoODK with the Cadasta Platform, you'll need to configure GeoODK for direct syncing. To do this, you'll need to set up your Cadasta account if you haven't already \(see [Getting Started](01-gettingstarted.md)\).

1. Once you've installed GeoODK, open the application.
2. From the map screen, hit the button with the four squares on the right. Then select **Settings** from the Main Menu, then **General Settings**, then **Configure Platform Settings**.

### GeoODK Troubleshooting {#geoodk-troubleshooting}

 

#### Loading Your Questionnaire

##### I can't connect to the Cadasta server because my username and password aren't working. (And yes, I've checked to make sure it's correct!)

The easiest thing to do here is to go to the Cadasta platform and change your password. Then, return to GeoODK and load your password there.  

##### I'm getting a message that says to "Wait a moment," but it's been more than a few moments.

If the above screen is taking longer than you think it should, hit Cancel. You may be correctly connected, or you may be asked to enter your username and password again.
