#Downloading Data

At some point during the project, you may need to download your data - perhaps for analysis using third-party software, creating a localized backup, or migrating data to another platform.

The Cadasta Platform makes this a relatively straightforward process. 

1. From the project overview page, select the three-dots menu at the top right. Then select **Download data**.

2. Next, select your desired file format:
  * **SHP** - a .zip full of shape files for your project locations, relationships, and parties; 
  * **XLS** - details of the locations, relationships and parties as an XLS file;
  * **Resources** - a .zip file containing all project resource files (images, videos, audio and other associated files); or
  * **All data** - a .zip file containing both the details of all locations, relationships and parties as well as the resource files.

3. Finally, select **Download** and the file will begin downloading.
