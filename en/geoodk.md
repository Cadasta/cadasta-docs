# Open Data Kit \(ODK\) Collect User Guide

Field data collection is an important part of the land and resource rights documentation process. Cadasta Platform is designed to easily accommodate a variety of tools for data collection, allowing for easy ingestion of data. This guide will show you how to use ODK for data collection and to streamline the process of getting accurate geospatially enabled data into the platform.

ODK is a free, open source mobile data collection application for Android devices \(sorry Apple fans\). To get started, please [download ODK.](/ http://geomarvel-projects.s3.amazonaws.com/cadasta/collect-cadasta-dev.apk) Note that we have a customized ODK Collect version that we host ourselves, so if you already have installed, you will need to replace with this version.

## **Initial Setup**

If this is the first time you have used ODK with the Cadasta Platform, you will need to configure ODK for direct syncing with the  Platform. In order to do this, you will first need to setup your Cadasta account if you haven't already \(see getting started\).

1. Once you have installed ODK, please open the application.
2. Select **General Settings** from the home page using the menu key.
