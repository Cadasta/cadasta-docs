### Overview {#overview}

Projects are the cornerstone of the Cadasta Platform, putting many of your project's assets into one place, including:

* Project Locations
* Project Members, and 
* Project Resources

### Setting Up a New Project {#setting-up-new-project}

Once you've created your organization, you can start to add projects.

#### 1. Navigate to the "Add project" button.

You can find the **Add project** button in one of two ways. The first way is from your Organization Overview page:

> \[add image\]

And the second way is by clicking the **Project** button at the top of the page, and then clicking **Add**.

> \[add image\]

#### 2. Navigate to your project location

Your project location is the geographic area where field data collection activities take place. You can find your area on the map using a couple different approaches.

##### a. Zooming from the map

> \[add diagram overview of Map View to this section.\]

From the map view, use the `+` and `-` signs on the upper left to zoom in and out.

In the upper right, you can choose from a couple of different layers depending on what kind of map you need.

The default layer is the graphic OpenStreetMap layer, shown above. You can also select the DigitalGlobe Satellite layer:

##### b. Search by a geographic Place Name

Click on the magnifying glass in the upper left to search for your location by name.

> \[add image\]

#### 3. Create your project area.

To create your project area, you can draw either a rectangle or a polygon.

Note that your project area does not need to be exact. To ensure full coverage, add a little bit of space outside the area where you'll be working.

**To draw a polygon**, click the polygon button. Then, start clicking points on the map to draw your shape.

> \[add image\]

You can edit your polygon by clicking the Edit button.

> \[add image\]

From there, you can click to add each point of your polygon to its intended location. To close the polygon, click on the first point that you added.

**To draw a rectangle**, select the rectangle icon. Then, click and drag over your project area on the map.

> \[add image\]

**To edit your project area**, select the edit icon. Then, click and drag the points on your polygon or rectangle to their correct location. When you're done, click the gray Save button on the left.

#### 4. Save your work!

Once you've drawn your project area to your satisfaction, click the green **Save and continue** button on the right.

#### 5. Provide some general information about the project.

At this stage, you will be asked to fill out some General Information regarding the project, including:

* **Project name**

* **Project privacy preference**, or whether the project will be Public or Private. Public projects are viewable by anyone, whereas private projects are only available to your organization.

* **Project description**

* **Project URL**, which must start with _http:\/\/_.

* **Project Questionnaire**, which is the spreadsheet you'll use as the basis for [custom data collection](/en/XLSForms.md).

> Note: add direct links to publicly available questionnaires.

* **Project contacts**, if any. Note that project contacts are not necessarily the same thing as project members.

If you're adding a project by navigating from the Project page, you'll also be asked to select the **Project's organization** from a dropdown menu at the top.

#### 6. Add project members

When you're done adding your general information, you can add project members.

#### 7. Add project locations {#add-project-locations}

Within any given project, you may be working with lots of different locations. For example, within a forested area, there may be a national park boundary or building that you'll need to track.

Select whether your location is to be displayed as a point, line, polygon, or rectangle, and then draw it on the map. 

> [add diagram]

Then add some information about this location, including:

* Location Type
* Name of Location
* Spacial Unit Quality
* How Location was Acquired, and
* Any other information about the location. 

> Note: get more information about each of these specifics and how they relate to uploading data from a questionnaire

_[More about project locations](#project-locations)_

####8. Add location relationship(s)

Each location may have a relationship with a person or group of people. To log those in the Cadasta Platform, click on the Relationships tab on the location overview page, then click **Add Relationship.**

> [add image]

In the pop-up that follows, click **Add new party** and then add some descriptive information, including:

* **Name**
* **Party Type** - whether it's an individual, corporation, or group. Corporations typically have some kind of formal organizational structure, whereas a group does not. 
* **Default Party Notes** - or notes about the party. 
* **Tenure Type** - what kind of rights the party has to the land, and
* **Tenure Notes** - any notes about the tenure. 

Add as many relationships as you need for the project location!

_[More about Relationships & Tenure Types]_

####9. Add location resources

Land rights projects can come with all kinds of documentation - including legal documents, letters, pictures and more.

Projects can have two types of resources: 

* Resources that relate to the project generally, and
* Resources that relate to a specific location. 

To add resources specific to your project location, click on the Resources tab in the Location Overview page. 

> [add image]

From there, you can either add items from your library of resources or upload them directly from your computer. 

Accepted file types are .pdf, .mp3, .mp4, .doc, .docx, .jpg and .png. If you'd like, give your resource a name and a brief descripton. 

####10. Add General project resources

Last but not least, add all of your non-location-specific project resources, if any. 

To add them, select the **Resources** button on the left. 

> [add image]

In the page that follows, click the green **Add** button in the upper left. 

> [add image]

Next you can either add resource from you library or upload one from your computer. Again, if you'd like, you can give your resources a name and a brief description.

When you're done with this step...

**Congratulations!** You've created your first project. 

### Editing a Project {#editing-a-project}

Once you've created a project, you may find that you need to make some changes. There are three aspects of a project that you can change:

* Project Location
* Project Details, and
* Member Permissions. 

To change any of these aspects of your project, navigate to your project page, and then click the three dots on the upper right of your screen. 

> [add image]

From there, select the item that needs to be changed. 

#### Editing Project Location


Once you've navigated to the Edit Project Location page, you can use the tools on the left of the map to make your project location changes changes. 

You can either click the edit icon and drag your boundary points as needed:

> [add image]

Or you can select the polygon or rectangle tools to draw completely new boundaries. 

When you're done, click the **gray Save button** on the left to save your shape, and the **green Save button** on the right to save your project location. 

####Editing Project Details

Once you've navigated to the Project Details page, you can edit information like the name, description, questionnaire or privacy settings. When you're done, save your changes by clicking the **Save** button at the bottom of the page. 

####Editing Member Permissions

Once you've navigated to the Edit Member Permissions page, you can change your member permissions by using the drop-down menu for each member. 

> [add image]

To learn more about member permissions and what they mean, read on to the next section.

### Project Members & Member Permissions {#project-members-member-permissions}

When you create members of your project, you must assign them permissions. These permissions will define user accesses and privileges for using the platform. Currently, there are five user roles, defined below with details regarding access rights:

*  **Administrator**. The Administrator can create new projects within an organization, manages user roles and access, and has full permissions regarding accessing and editing data. 

* **Project Manager**. The Project Manager works within an organization on a specific project, and with regard to that project can access and edit all data within the project, including adding new users to the project and setting access rights.

* **Data Collector**. The Data Collector works in the field with the communities to collect data using Field Papers, Mobile Applications, or by directly entering data into the platform. The Data Collector can add data in a project, but cannot edit existing data. 

* **Project User**. The Project User can view all data within the project, even if it is set to private. The Project User does not have the ability to add or edit data. 

* **Public User**. A Public User can view only data that is publicly available.
