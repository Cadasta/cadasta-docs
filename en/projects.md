# Projects

Now that you have established an organization it is now time to set up your project\(s\). As noted in the introduction, an organization might have multiple projects for data collection. These could be different in geographical area, scope, community, etc.

To add a project, either proceed directly from adding your organization, or navigate to your newly established organization by clicking the organization ta at the top of the page and locating your organization.

1. From the Organization Overview page, select “Add a new project.”

2. The first step will be to define a project location, in other words, where the field data collection activities will take place.

3. To find the project location, you might use a couple of approaches, as depicted in the image below, you might:

  1. Zoom directly to the project location using the OpenStreetMap layer \(see A below for zoom tools\)’.

  2. Turn on the satellite imagery to help identify the project location;

  3. Search a geographic place name.

4. After selecting the project area, either through creating a polygon or drawing a rectangle, please select “Save and Continue.” _note: the project area does not need to be precisely defined, just make sure you’ve covered all areas you may be working leaving a comfortable buffer on the margins._

5. You will now be asked to fill out “General Information” regarding the project; including

  1. Project name;

  2. Whether the project will be Public or Private;

  3. The Project description;

  4. The Project URL;

  5. The questionnaire \(see next section for details\);

  6. Project contacts.
