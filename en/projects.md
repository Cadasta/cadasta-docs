### Setting Up a New Project {#setting-up-new-project}

Once you've created your organization, you can start to add projects.

#####2. Navigate to your project location

Your project location is the geographic area where field data collection activities take place. You can find your area on the map using a couple different approaches.

#####a. Zooming from the map

> [add diagram overview of Map View to this section.]

From the map view, use the `+` and `-` signs on the upper left to zoom in and out. 

In the upper right, you can choose from a couple of different layers depending on what kind of map you need. 

The default layer is the graphic OpenStreetMap layer, shown above. You can also select the DigitalGlobe Satellite layer:

#####3. Create your project area. 

To create your project area, you can draw either a rectangle or a polygon. 

To draw a **polygon**, click the polygon button. Then, start clicking points on the map to draw your shape.

You can edit your polygon by clicking the Edit button. 

> [add image]

From there, you can drag each point on your polygon to its intended location.

Note that your project area does not need to be exact. To ensure full coverage, you may want to add a little bit of of space outside the area where you'll be working. 

#####4. Save your work!



#####5. Provide some general information about the project. 

2. You will now be asked to fill out **General Information** regarding the project, including:

  1. Project name

  2. Whether the project will be Public or Private

  3. The Project description

  4. The Project URL

  5. The questionnaire \(see the custom data selection section for details\); and

  6. Project contacts



### Project Members & Member Permissions {#project-members-member-permissions}

1. Now that the General Information of the project is defined, you will be asked to **Assign Permissions to Members**. These permissions will define user accesses and privileges for using the platform. Currently, there are five user roles, defined below with details regarding access rights:
  1. **Administrator**. The Administrator can create new projects within an organization, manages user roles and access, and has full permissions regarding accessing and editing data. 
  2. **Project Manager**. The Project Manager works within an organization on a specific project, and with regard to that project can access and edit all data within the project, including adding new users to the project and setting access rights.
  3. **Data Collector**. The Data Collector works in the field with the communities to collect data using Field Papers, Mobile Applications, or by directly entering data into the platform. The Data Collector can add data in a project, but cannot edit existing data. 
  4. **Project User**. The Project User can view all data within the project, even if it is set to private. The Project User does not have the ability to add or edit data. 
  5. **Public User**. A Public User can view only data that is publicly available.
