### Overview {#overview}

Projects are the cornerstone of the Cadasta Platform, and they are made up of the following:

* Project Location
* Project Members
* Project Resources

### Setting Up a New Project {#setting-up-new-project}

Once you've created your organization, you can start to add projects. 

#####1. Navigate to the "Add project" button. 

You can find the **Add project** button in one of two ways. The first way is from your Organization Overview page:

And the second way is by clicking the **Project** button at the top of the page, and then clicking **Add**.

#####2. Navigate to your project location

Your project location is the geographic area where field data collection activities take place. You can find your area on the map using a couple different approaches.

######a. Zooming from the map

> [add diagram overview of Map View to this section.]

From the map view, use the `+` and `-` signs on the upper left to zoom in and out. 

In the upper right, you can choose from a couple of different layers depending on what kind of map you need. 

The default layer is the graphic OpenStreetMap layer, shown above. You can also select the DigitalGlobe Satellite layer:

Click on the magnifying glass in the upper left to search for your location by name.

#####3. Create your project area. 

To create your project area, you can draw either a rectangle or a polygon. 

Note that your project area does not need to be exact. To ensure full coverage, add a little bit of space outside the area where you'll be working. 

**To draw a polygon**, click the polygon button. Then, start clicking points on the map to draw your shape. 

> [add image]

You can edit your polygon by clicking the Edit button. 

> [add image]

From there, you can click to add each point of your polygon to its intended location. To close the polygon, click on the first point that you added.  

**To draw a rectangle**, select the rectangle icon. Then, click and drag over your project area on the map.

**To edit your project area**, select the edit icon. Then, click and drag the points on your polygon or rectangle to their correct location. When you're done, click the gray Save button on the left.

#####4. Save your work!

Once you've drawn your project area to your satisfaction, click the green **Save and continue** button on the right. 

#####5. Provide some general information about the project. 

At this stage, you will be asked to fill out some General Information regarding the project, including:

*  **Project name**

*  **Project privacy preference**, or whether the project will be Public or Private. Public projects are viewable by anyone, whereas private projects are only available to your organization.

* **Project description**

* **Project URL**, which must start with _http://_.

* **Project Questionnaire**, which is the spreadsheet you'll use as the basis for [custom data collection](/en/XLSForms.md). 

> Note: add direct links to publicly available questionnaires.

* **Project contacts**, if any. Note that project contacts are not necessarily the same thing as project members.

If you're adding a project by navigating from the Project page, you'll also be asked to select the **Project's organization** from a dropdown menu at the top. 

#####6. Add project members

When you're done adding your general information, you can add project members to the project.

### Project Members & Member Permissions {#project-members-member-permissions}

1. Now that the General Information of the project is defined, you will be asked to **Assign Permissions to Members**. These permissions will define user accesses and privileges for using the platform. Currently, there are five user roles, defined below with details regarding access rights:
  1. **Administrator**. The Administrator can create new projects within an organization, manages user roles and access, and has full permissions regarding accessing and editing data. 
  2. **Project Manager**. The Project Manager works within an organization on a specific project, and with regard to that project can access and edit all data within the project, including adding new users to the project and setting access rights.
  3. **Data Collector**. The Data Collector works in the field with the communities to collect data using Field Papers, Mobile Applications, or by directly entering data into the platform. The Data Collector can add data in a project, but cannot edit existing data. 
  4. **Project User**. The Project User can view all data within the project, even if it is set to private. The Project User does not have the ability to add or edit data. 
  5. **Public User**. A Public User can view only data that is publicly available.
