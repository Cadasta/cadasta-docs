#Importing Data

If you've already been collecting data in another system and are switching to the Cadasta Platform, you can import your data in a .csv. This can be useful if you have many questionnaires to import, whether you have 10 or 10,000.

> David, what information do I need to tell them about the fields in the CSV? What is required, if anything?

To do this, navigate to the main project page. There, select the three dots on the upper right, and then Import Data. 

> add image: David, can you get an image of this from the Uttaran project? It would be helpful to have for consistency. 

Next, you'll come to a page where you can give the file a name, and select your .csv for uploading.

> David, what is the best practice for saving the file as a project resource? It makes a duplicate or something? Why would you want to do that?

* **Building** - any kind of structure.
* **Apartment** - an apartment or apartment building.
* **Project Extent** - the full boundary of the project.
* **Right-of-Way** - an easement that allows a person or group of people to pass throuh another's land.
* **Utility Corridor** - a passage, either overground or underground, meant to carry utility lines like electricity and water. 
* **National Park Boundary** - the boundary between a national park and another kind of land. 
* **Miscellaneous** - another kind of location that doesn't fit into any of your categories.

Your geometry fields can be one of the following:
