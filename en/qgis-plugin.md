If you need to visually analyze the data you've been collecting, you can do so with an application called QGIS [link]. QGIS is a free open source GIS analysis that works similarly to ESRI's ArcGIS. 

In this section, you'll learn how to link QGIS to your Cadasta project and use it to analyze the data you've collected. 

To learn more about QGIS, visit [URL].

## Getting Set Up {#setup}

### 1. Installing QGIS

> add links

The first thing you need to do is install QGIS. To do this, visit [URL]. There, you'll find links the appropriate version to install on your computer. 

This documentation shows install using a Mac. If you are using a PC, visit [URL] to learn more about how to install it. 

On a Mac, the .dmg you'll download includes four .pkg files, each of which needs to be installed:

* [list]
* [list]
* [list]
* [list]

Depending on your security settings, you may get a message like this one, telling you that you do not have permission to install applications from an unknown source. 

> add image

To fix this, go to System Preferences > Security. There, press OK to allow the application to be installed.

> add image

You may have to do this for each one of the .pkg files.

Once you've completed this step, you should be able to open QGIS from your application window.

### 2. Installing the Cadasta Plugin

Next, install the Cadasta Plugin by Selecting Plugins > Manage Plugins from the top. 

### 3. Importing Your Project

Now connect to the appropriate server: 

* `https://demo.cadasta.org`, or 
* `https://platform.cadasta.org`

You'll need to enter your username and password. 

**Note!** If you need to switch servers, hit **Clear** on the bottom right before re-entering your credentials.
