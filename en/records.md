# Record Management

Now that you have set up your organization and project, it's time to start recording land information.

The first step in defining the spatial details of a location for which a right is to be assigned.  Defining the location can be done in a number of ways - collecting coordinates from a GPS unit, utilizing Field Papers and tracing boundaries, direct data collection from GeoODK, or digitizing from imagery.  We will begin with digitizing from imagery.

## Digitizing from Imagery

After logging into the Platform and navigating to your project, select "Add a Location" to begin data entry.
