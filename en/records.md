# Record Management

Now that you have set up your organization and project, it's time to start recording land information.

The first step in defining the spatial details of a location for which a right is to be assigned.  Defining the location can be done in a number of ways - collecting coordinates from a GPS unit, utilizing Field Papers and tracing boundaries, direct data collection from GeoODK, or digitizing from imagery.  We will begin with digitizing from imagery.

## Digitizing from Imagery

1. After logging into the Platform and navigating to your project, select "Add a Location" to begin data entry.

2. You can then use the drawing tools \(see A below\) to draw the location on the map as a point, line, or polygon.  If imagery is needed, remember that you can change the background by switching the map layers \(see B below\). Also note the boundary of the project area shaded in a dotted line as defined during the creationn of the project \(see C below\).

3. It's not time to begin filling in property details as defined
