###Overview {#overview}

Field data collection is an important part of the land and resource rights documentation process. The Cadasta Platform is designed to easily accommodate a variety of tools for data collection, allowing for ingestion of data. One of those tools is Open Data Kit, or ODK Collect (which we refer to as ODK for short).

ODK is a free, open source mobile data collection application for Android devices \(sorry Apple fans\). To get started, please [download ODK Collect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en) from the Google Play Store, or wherever you acquire your applications.

This guide will show you how to use ODK Collect for data collection and to streamline the process of getting accurate geospatially enabled data directly into the platform.

### Initial Setup {#initial-setup}

To get started, [download ODK from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geoodk.collect.android), or wherever you acquire your applications.

If this is the first time you've used ODK with the Cadasta Platform, you'll need to configure ODK for direct syncing. To do this, you'll need to set up your Cadasta account if you haven't already \(see [Getting Started](01-gettingstarted.md)\).

1. Once you've installed ODK, open the application.

2. From the opening screen (the Main Menu), tap the three dots in the upper right, then select **General Settings**, then **Configure Platform Settings**.

3. On this screen, enter the Platform URL along with your a username and password. The username and password do not have to be the same as they are on your Cadasta account, and the URL you need should be similar to the one you used when you signed up for your Cadasta account. 

    * https://platform.cadasta.org/collect \(if for active projects\); or

    * https://demo.cadasta.org/collect  \(if for testing\)
