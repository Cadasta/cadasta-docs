### Creating a New Organization {#creating-a-new-organization}

If your organization doesn't already exist in the Cadasta platform, then one of the first things you need to do is set up your organization's account. You'll use your organizational account to manage projects, organization members, data collection forms, and more.

##### 1. Log in & Navigate to the Organizations Page

Log into your account, which will take you to the main Cadasta Platform page. In the upper right, select the **Organizations** button.

##### 2. Add Your Organization

On the next page, you'll see an index of all the organizations using the Cadasta Platform. Select **Add** on the upper right to add your organization.

##### 3. Enter Your Organization's Information

On the page that follows, provide your organization name, a brief description, the URL for your organization's website and your own contact information as well. If you'd like, you can add additional contacts for your organization here as well.

**_NOTE!_** _Adding someones contact information here does not create user accounts for them within the Cadasta Platform. _

Once you hit save...

##### Congratulations!

You've established an organization within the Cadasta Platform!

As the person who has created the organization, you are now the organization's administrator by default.

### Editing Your Organization's Information {#editing-your-organizations-information}

Administrators can edit an organization's information from the Organization Overview page. Click on the three dots in the upper right corner of the page, select **Edit organization**, and then modify the information as needed.

Administrators may also archive their organization by selecting **Archive organization **from the same menu.
