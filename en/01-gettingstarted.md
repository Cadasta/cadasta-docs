## How Cadasta is Structured {#how-cadasta-is-organized}

While anyone can use the Cadasta Platform, it's designed primarily for organizations who are doing projects to help people document their land rights. The platform is primarily designed to fit their needs and is structured accordingly.

Before jumping in, it's important to understand this structure and how everything works together. 

* At the core of the Cadasta platform are a series of **projects**. A project covers a specific geographic area. Within that area, there can be numerous project **locations**. A project may also have multiple **project members**, each of whom will have permissions specific to the project.

* Each project must belong to an **organization**, which is made up of **organization members**. 

* The structure of the data you're collecting for your project depends on how you've structured your **questionnaire**, which is required to set up your project. To learn more about how questionnaires work, [read this section](08-XLSForms.md).

* Each project also tracks the **relationships** that a party may have to one of it's locations. In addition, each location may also need to track specific **resources** - like deeds or images of the location - that can help with land rights documentation. All of the location resources are stored in the project **library**.


If you were to view all these parts as an outline, it would look something like this:

* Organization
 * Organization Members
 * Project
     * Project Members
     * Project Locations
         * Overview (determined by the structure of the questionnaire)
         * Relationships
         * Resources

Typically data for each project is collected in the field using mobile devices. The Cadasta Platform supports two mobile data collection platforms:

* **Open Data Kit (ODK)**, and
* **Geo Open Data Kit (GeoOKD)**.

Both of these platforms integrate with your questionnaire, ensuring that the data you're collecting is in your desired format.

Whenever you need your data, all you have to do is download it.

1. [**Create your new account**](#createnewaccount)**[. ](#createnewaccount)**Once you have a new account, you can create your organization and projects, or be added to an organization. Once you're attached to an organization, you become a **member** of that organization and can be added to projects.

2. **[Create your organization](/2-organizations.md)[.](/2-organizations.md)** **Organizations** are made up of organization members, which must be Cadasta Platform users. The user who creates the organization becomes its administrator by default. Administrators can do things like add members to the organization, create projects, and set member permissions for projects.

3. **[Create your fi](/projects.md)**[**r**](/en/projects.md)**[st project.](/projects.md)** **Projects** are specific land rights or land management initiatives, and they must belong to an organization. Projects are made up of team members, project contacts, resources \(like photos or other documentation\), and a map.
