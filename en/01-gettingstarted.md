### How Cadasta is Structured {#how-cadasta-is-organized}

While anyone can use the Cadasta Platform, it's designed primarily for organizations working to document land and resource rights of individuals and communities. The Platform is primarily designed to fit their needs and is structured accordingly.

Before jumping in, it's important to understand the Platform structure and how everything works together.

* At the core of the Cadasta platform are a series of **[projects](03-projects.md)**. A project covers a specific geographic area. Within that area, there can be numerous project **locations**. A project may also have multiple **project members**, each of whom will have permissions specific to the project.

* Each project must belong to an **[organization](02-organizations.md)**. An organization represents an organized body of people with a particular purpose. In most cases, organizations are NGOs helping communities to document their land rights. In the Cadasta system, people who belong to an organization are called **organization members**. 

* The structure of the data you're collecting for your project depends on how you've structured your **[questionnaire](08-XLSForms.md)**, which is required to set up your project.

* In addition to storing geographic data, each project is also meant to store a series of **[records](04-records.md)**. These records may include **resources** about the location, such as scanned documents, images, video or audio testimonials or anything else that can help with land rights documentation. All of the location resources are stored in the project **library**. In addition, each project can also track **relationships** that a various parties may have to one of it's locations.


If you were to view all these parts as an outline, it would look something like this:

* Organization
  * Organization Members
  * Project
    * Project Members
    * Project Locations
      * Overview \(determined by the structure of the questionnaire\)
      * Relationships
      * Resources


Typically data for each project is collected in the field. This might be doing using mobile applications paper questionnaires, or applicatios like Field Papers . The Cadasta Platform currently supports two mobile data collection platforms:

* **[Open Data Kit \(ODK\)](05-odkcollect.md)**, and
* **[Geo Open Data Kit \(GeoOKD\)](06-geoodkcollect.md)**.

Both of these applications integrate with your questionnaire, ensuring that the data you're collecting is in your desired format.

Whenever you need to get your data and resources out of the Cadasta platform, all you have to do is [download it](07-download.md).

### Quick Guide to Getting Started {#quick-guide-to-getting-started}

To get started, follow the steps below! For more information and images, follow the links on each step.* 

1. **[Create your new account](#createnewaccount)** by clicking **register** and entering your name, email, and a few other key pieces of information. 

2. Next, you need to be added to an organization. To do this, contact your organization's administrator to add you as an organization member. Note that you can be added to multiple organizations in the Cadasta sytem.  

    * If you're going to be the administrator of a new organization in Cadasta, you can **[create your organization](02-organizations.md)** by selecting the **Organizations** button and then **Add**. You'll be asked to enter some basic information about your organization and save it. The person who creates an organization becomes the organization's administrator. Note that most users will not create their own organizations; instead they will be added to one. 

3. The next thing you need to do is **[create your first project](03-projects.md).** As part of the project creation process, you'll be asked to upload a questionnaire, which creates the structure for your location data collection. If you don't have one of your own, you can use either this [minimal questionnaire](assets/Minimum_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx) or this [standard questionnaire](assets/standard_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx). You'll also need to add project members, project locations, and project resources as needed. 

4. Start gathering data! If you need to collect data in the field, you can use either [ODK](/en/05-odkcollect.md) or [GeoODK](/en/06-geoodkcollect.md).
