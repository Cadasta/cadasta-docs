###Cadasta & Data{#data}

####Where does your map data come from?

####Once I upload my data to the Cadasta Platform, do I still own it? 
Absolutely! Cadasta users will always retain full ownership of their data.

###Using the Questionnaire{#using-the-questionnaire}

####Why are some fields gray in questionnaire and others white?

Fields that are in gray shouldn't be modified, while fields in white easily can be. Read [Questionnaires & Custom Data Collection](08-XLSForms.md) to learn more about how to custimize your questionnaire. 

####Can I delete or modify fields that are in gray?

You can, but it's not a good idea. The only exception is when creating a dropdown for toggling between GeoTrace, GeoShape, and GeoPoint options. Read more about that in the Advanced Customization section of the [Questionnaires & Custom Data Collection](08-XLSForms.md) page. 

####I need help customizing my questionnaire. Is there anyone who can help me?

Cadasta would be happy to help you customize your questionnaire. [Contact us](http://cadasta.org/contact/) about this any time, and we'll get back to you as soon as we can.
