## Overview {#overview}

The Cadasta Platform has a global audience, which means it should ideally be translated into as many languages as possible. 

You can view which languages are currently available using the drop-down menu one the bottom right of the screen:

To create and manage translations, Cadasta uses <a href="https://www.transifex.com/" target="_blank">Transifex</a> â€“ an online translation management application. In this section, you'll learn how to use Transifex to translate the Cadasta Platform.

For complete documentation about Transifex, visit <a href="https://docs.transifex.com/" target="_blank">docs.transifex.com</a>.

## Translating the Cadasta Platform with Transifex {#translating-with-transifex}

Transifex works by identifying all of the strings (non-code portions of the software files) and organizing them into a checklist-like format. This format allows users to translate each string file by file, line by line. 

Before getting started with your translation, you'll need to do two things:

1. **Create a user account,** which you can do for free at Transifex.com. 

2. **Get added to the Cadasta translation team.** You'll be invited to join by someone from Cadasta. <a href="http://cadasta.org/contact/" target="_blank">Contact us</a> to request being added.

Once you've been added to the team, you can get started with your translation.

From the top of the dashboard, click on **Translate**:

Then, using the drop-down menu in the upper left, select which language you'd like to translate to.

On the next screen, you can select which resources you'd like to start with:

Here, the blue lines underneath the file names (`allauth`, `javascript`, and `main`) indicate how much of the file has been translated. 

In some cases, like below, you'll see both a light blue and a dark blue line. The light blue line indicates how much has been translated, while dark blue indicates how many have been reviewed.

From this view, click on a set of resources. On the the next page you'll come to a checklist of all the lines that need to be translated.

Here, translators can translate each line one-by-one using the panel on the right. Remember to save your work frequently!

When you're done, let the team at Cadasta know so that your work can be reviewed and pushed to live.

## Important Notes: Transifex & Translation {#important-notes}

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when it comes to translating the Cadasta platform using Transifex. 

1. **Keep an eye on your translation, even after you're done.** New releases bring with them edits to copy and new sections to be translated. It doesn't take long for a complete translation to become a partial one.

2. **Use the Transifex online editor!** Transifex offers both an online and offline editor. At this time, we don't recommend using the offline editor for translation. Instead, please use the online editor described above. 

## Requesting a New Translation Project {#new-project}
