### Overview {#overview}

The Cadasta Platform has a global audience, which means it should ideally be translated into as many languages as possible. 

To create new translations, Cadasta uses a piece of software called Transifex. Transifex can be used to 

### Current Translations.

So far, the Platform has been translated into three languages:

* English
* Indonesian

### About Transifex {#about-transifex}

The Cadasta Platform can be translated using <a href="https://www.transifex.com/" target="_blank">Transifex</a>, a software platform designed for software translation. It works by identifying all of the strings (non-code portions of the software files) and then uses a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to translate them file by file, line by line. 

Using Transifex helps translators keep track of how much they have to translate and how much is left. It updates as the Platform updates, showing new sections of code that still need to be addressed.

In the above example, you can see that the English version (the original version) is 100% completed, while the Indonesian version is 82% complete.

As someone translating the Cadasta Platform, you may be doing one of two things:

* Contributing to an existing translation project, or
* Starting a new translation project. 

Let's walk through how to do both of these.

### Contributing to an Existing Translation Project {#contributing}

* Who clones the platform?

* How are projects added to Transifex?

As a translator, you'll likely be asked to translate an existing project, without having to set it up in Transifex.

Before getting started, however, you'll need to do two things:

1. **Create an account,** which you can do for free from Transifex.com. 

2. **Get added to the translation team.** You can do this by asking the person leading the project to add you. _Team leaders see [Adding Translators to your Translation Project](#adding-translators) for information about how to do this._

Once you've been added to the team, you can get started with your translation.

From the dashboard, click on **Translate**:
