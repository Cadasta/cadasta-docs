### Overview {#overview}

The Cadasta Platform has a global audience, which means it should ideally be translated into as many languages as possible. 

So far, the Platform has been translated into three languages:

* English
* Indonesian
* Portuguese

To view one of these translations, select it from the drop-down menu at the bottom right of the screen:

To create and manage translations, Cadasta uses <a href="https://www.transifex.com/" target="_blank">Transifex</a> â€“ an online translation management application. In this section, you'll learn how to use Transifex to translate the Cadasta Platform.

### Transifex Overview {#transifex-overview}

Transifex works by identifying all of the strings (non-code portions of the software files) and organizing them into a checklist-like format that allows users to translate each string file by file, line by line.

The top portion of the Dashboard provides a brief overview of the 


On the bottom portion of the Dashboard, you can see all of the languages currently being translated or that have been translated already. Complete translations are show a green Ready for Use message on the right hand side.

Throughout the application, completion is indicated by blue bars. Light blue bars indicate the amount that has been translated. Darker blue bars indicate how much of the translations have been reviewed. 


Using Transifex helps translators keep track of what they have translated and how much is left. This information updates as the Platform updates, showing new sections of code that need to be addressed. It's important to keep an eye on your translation, as new releases bring with them new sections of code.

As someone translating the Cadasta Platform, you may be doing one of two things:

* Contributing to an existing translation project, or
* Starting a new translation project. 

Let's walk through how to do both of these.

### Contributing to an Existing Translation Project {#contributing}

* Who clones the platform?
* How are translators added to Transifex? 
* How are projects added to Transifex?

As a translator, you'll likely be asked to translate an existing project, without having to set it up in Transifex.

Before getting started, however, you'll need to do two things:

1. **Create an account,** which you can do for free from Transifex.com. 

2. **Get added to the translation team.** You can do this by asking the person leading the project to add you. _Team leaders see [Adding Translators to your Translation Project](#adding-translators) for information about how to do this._

Once you've been added to the team, you can get started with your translation.

From the dashboard, click on **Translate**:

Then, using the drop-down menu in the upper left, select which language you'd like to translate to.

On the next screen, you can select which resources you'd like to start with:

Here, the blue lines underneath the file names (`allauth`, `javascript`, and `resources`) indicate how much of the file has been translated (light blue) and how many of the translations have been reviewed (dark blue).

Click on a set of resources, and on the the next page you'll come to a checklist of all the lines that need to be translated.

Here, translators can translate each line one-by-one using the panel on the right. Remember to save your work frequently!
