## Overview {#overview}

The Cadasta Platform has a global audience, which means it should ideally be translated into as many languages as possible. 

In this section, you'll learn about the language options available on the Cadasta platform and via your [Cadasta XLSForm](09-XLSForms.md), as well as how to translate the platform to your desired language.

## Language Options on the Platform & Via Cadasta XLSForms {#language-options}

The Cadasta Platform has been translated into a few different languages. You can view which languages are currently available using the drop-down menu one the bottom right of the screen:

The dropdown above is available anywhere on the platform.

In addition, [Cadasta XLSForms](09-XLSForms.md) can be written in over 100 different supported languages. To view your questions or data that has been collected in one of these languages, navigate to the Project Overview page, and then use the drop-down menu on the top right to select your language.

## Translating the Cadasta Platform with Transifex {#translating-with-transifex}

To create and manage Platform translations, Cadasta uses <a href="https://www.transifex.com/" target="_blank">Transifex</a> â€“ an online translation management application. In this section, you'll learn how to use Transifex to translate the Cadasta Platform.

For complete documentation about Transifex, visit <a href="https://docs.transifex.com/" target="_blank">docs.transifex.com</a>.

Transifex works by identifying all of the strings (non-code portions of the software files) and organizing them into a checklist-like format. This format allows users to translate each string file by file, line by line. 

Before getting started with your translation, you'll need to do two things:

1. **Create a user account,** which you can do for free at Transifex.com. 

2. **Get added to the Cadasta translation team.** You'll be invited to join by someone from Cadasta. <a href="http://cadasta.org/contact/" target="_blank">Contact us</a> to request being added.

Once you've been added to the team, you can get started with your translation.

From the top of the dashboard, click on **Translate**:

Then, using the drop-down menu in the upper left, select which language you'd like to translate to.

On the next screen, you can select which resources you'd like to start with:

![](/assets/transifex-04-ai.png)

Here, the blue lines underneath the file names (`allauth`, `javascript`, and `main`) indicate how much of the file has been translated. 

In some cases, like below, you'll see both a light blue and a dark blue line. The light blue line indicates how much has been translated, while dark blue indicates how many have been reviewed.

From this view, click on a set of resources. On the the next page you'll come to a checklist of all the lines that need to be translated.

Here, translators can translate each line one-by-one using the panel on the right. Remember to save your work frequently!

When you're done, let the team at Cadasta know so that your work can be reviewed and pushed to live.

## Important Notes: Transifex & Translation {#important-notes}

There are a couple of things to keep in mind when it comes to translating the Cadasta platform using Transifex. 

1. **Keep an eye on your translation, even after you're done.** New releases bring with them edits to copy and new sections to be translated. It doesn't take long for a complete translation to become a partial one.

2. **Use the Transifex online editor!** Transifex offers both an online and offline editor. At this time, we don't recommend using the offline editor for translation. Instead, please use the online editor described above. 

## Requesting a New Translation Project {#new-project}

If you would like to request a new translation of the Cadasta platform, please don't hesitate to <a href="http://cadasta.org/contact/" target="_blank">contact Us</a>.
