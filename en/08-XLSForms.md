# Questionnaires & Custom Data Collection

### Overview {#overview}

Every data collection project is different, meaning they each need different fields for data collection.

The Cadasta platform allows you to define your own data collection schema, as we know that data needs vary with the context.  

Our platform structures the data around three core entities: 
* the **Party** \(a person, family, community or organization\), 
* the **Place** and 
* the **Relationship** \(rights, restrictions and responsibilities connecting the Party to the Place\).

In order to define the data collection parameter of your organization, we utilize the [XLSForm](http://xlsform.org/) format as an easy way to set how the data is collected, managed and queried.  XLSForm is a form standard based on authoring forms using a spreadsheet.  The forms are easy to use, while also allowing more complex forms and dependencies for those more familiar with XLSForms.

The fields defined within the form are associated with either the Place, Party or Relationship. The user has the ability to add as many fields as needed, customized to their local context.  These could include fields for contact details, names of family members, geographic place names, how the land was aquired, or even information more relevant for a census, such as information on health, education or public services.

We have provided a couple of forms to help our partners get started:

* [A minimalist form](assets/Minimum_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx) for the bare minimum of data needed to be successfully linked to the platform and which users can add to; and
* A [standard form](assets/standard_cadasta_questionnaire_0.2.xlsx) that is the starting point for many of our partners.

You can use either of these forms as starting points for your own custom data collection. 

To learn more about what these forms are, read on! If you have questions about these forms, [contact us](cadasta.org/contact/) at any time.
