# Organizations

As a first time user, your priority may be to set up an organizational account to manage projects, users and data collection forms.

To create a new organization:

1. On the project index page select **Organizations**.

  ![](/assets/organization.png)

2. At this page you will be able to view public projects, as well as add your own by clicking **Add**.

3. After selecting **Add** within the Organizations page, you will need to fill out relevant details about the organization.


Congratulations! You’ve established an organization within the Cadasta platform!
