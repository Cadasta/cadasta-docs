# GeoODK User Guide

Field data collection is an important part of the land and resource rights documentation process. The Cadasta Platform is designed to easily accommodate a variety of tools for data collection, allowing for easy ingestion of data. This guide will show you how to use GeoODK for data collection and to streamline the process of getting accurate geospatially enabled data into the platform.

GeoODK is a free, open source mobile data collection application for Android devices \(sorry Apple fans\). To get started, please [download GeoODK](http://geoodk.com/) from your Android app store.

You will also need to install a plugin for your mobile device, [please download and install.](http://geomarvel-projects.s3.amazonaws.com/cadasta/collect-cadasta-dev.apk)

## **Initial Setup**

If this is the first time you have used GeoODK with the Cadasta platform, you will need to configure GeoODK to link with the Cadasta Platform. In order to do this, you will first need to setup an account on the Cadasta Platform if you haven't already \(see getting started\).
