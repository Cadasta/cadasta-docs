### Ringkasan {#overview}

Pengumpulan data lapangan merupakan salah satu bagian yang penting dalam proses pencatatan hak-hak atas tanah dan sumber daya. Platform Cadasta dirancang untuk menyediakan beberapa alat untuk pengumpulan data, dan memproses data-data tersebut. Salah satu alat ini disebut Open Data Kit, atau biasa disingkat dengan ODK Collect. 

ODK adalah perangkat lunak terbuka (open source) dan gratis untuk pengumpulan data secara mobile khusus Android \(maaf fans Apple)\. Untuk memulai, [download ODK Collect dari Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en), atau dari sumber manapun dimana Anda memperoleh aplikasi Anda. 

Bagian ini menjelaskan secara ringkas bagaimana ODK Collect dan Cadasta dapat bekerja sama: 

1. Pertama, Anda perlu [memasang ODK](#initial-setup) pada sebuah perangkat Android. 
2. Kemudian Anda akan [memuat kuesioner](#loading-your-form) yang Anda ingin gunakan untuk pengumpulan data. 
3. Terakhir, saatnya untuk [mengumpulkan data Anda](#data-collection)! 
4. Ketika Anda sudah memiliki jaringan WiFi, [upload data Anda](#uploading-data) ke Platform Cadasta.

**Penting!** Langkah 1, 2, dan 4 membutuhkan jaringan WiFi. Anda juga mungkin ingin melakukan ujio coba langkah ke-3 sebelum keluar lapangan, untuk menjaga apabila Anda perlu [menyelesaikan masalah](#odk-troubleshooting) atau membuat perubahan. 

Untuk informasi dan dokumentasi terkait ODK secara umum, kunjungi [opendatakit.org](https://opendatakit.org/).

### Initial Setup {#initial-setup}

To get started, [download ODK from the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.odk.collect.android&hl=en), or wherever you acquire your applications.

If this is the first time you've used ODK with the Cadasta Platform, you'll need to configure ODK for direct syncing. To do this, you'll need to set up your Cadasta account if you haven't already \(see [Getting Started](01-gettingstarted.md)\).

1. Once you've created your account and installed ODK, open the application.

2. From the opening screen (the Main Menu), tap the three dots in the upper right, then select **General Settings**, then **Configure Platform Settings**. 

    ![](/assets/odk-1-setup.png)

3. On this screen, enter the Platform URL along with your username and password. The username and password do not have to be the same as they are on your Cadasta account, but it may be helpful to keep them consistent. The URL you need should be similar to the one you used when you signed up for your Cadasta account. 

    * https://platform.cadasta.org/collect \(if for active projects\); or

    * https://demo.cadasta.org/collect  \(if for testing\)

    ![](/assets/odk-2-account-info.png)

You now have an ODK account that's synced with the Cadasta Platform.

Click the back button twice to return to the main menu.

### Loading your Questionnaire {#loading-your-form}

Once you've connected ODK with Cadasta, the next thing you need to do is load the questionnaire you're using for your data collection project.

1. From the main menu, select **Get Blank Form**.

    ![](/assets/odk-3-get-blank-form.png)

2. At this stage, you may be asked to provide your Cadasta username and password. Enter this information and then wait a few moments to be connected to the server.

3. In the page that follows, you'll see a list of questionnaires that have been loaded for your organization's projects. Place a checkmark next to the form you'd like to use and tap **Get Selected**.

    ![](/assets/odk-4-get-blank-form.png)

Now, ODK is configured to record data using the questions in your questionnaire.

### Data Collection {#data-collection}

Once you've initialized ODK and loaded your questionnaire, now itâ€™s time to collect some data!

1. From the ODK Main Menu select **Fill Blank Form** then the questionnaire that you want to use. 

    ![](/assets/odk-5-fill-blank-form.png)

2. Swipe left twice to get started completing the form.
3. Continue answering all the survey questions until you reach the "End of survey" message. During this step, swipe left after you've answered each question. 
    * During this section, you'll likely be asked to GeoTrace your location data, or add a GeoShape or GeoPoint. For more information about how this works, see [Collecting Location Data: GeoTrace, GeoPoint and GeoShape](#geotracing).
4. When all of your questions are completed, select the **Mark Form as finalized** checkbox and **Save Form and Exit**. 

### Collecting Location Data: GeoTrace, GeoShape, and GeoPoint {#geotracing}

During [data collection](#data-collection), you'll be asked to collect data specifying your location using one of the following options.

* **[GeoTrace](#geotrace)** creates lines  (collections of two or more GPS coordinates) based on your location. It's also the default option provided in both the standard and minimum questionnaires. 

* **[GeoShape](#geoshape)** creates polygons (closed shapes). To create a GeoShape, you can use your finger to draw a shape on the map.  

* **[GeoPoint](#geopoint)** creates points (single GPS coordinates) based on your location. 

To learn more about how to configure these options in your questionnaire, see [Questionnaires & Custom Data Collection](08-XLSForms.md).

#### GeoTrace {#geotrace}

When it's time to start your GeoTrace, you'll be prompted to **Start GeoTrace**:

![](/assets/odk-geotrace-1.png)

In the next screen, you'll be asked to **Zoom to Current Location**.

![](/assets/odk-geotrace-2.png)


Once your location is identified, you'll be asked to select either Automatic or Manual mode.  

![](/assets/odk-geotrace-3.png)

**Manual mode** allows you to record your geotrace manually. Every time you want to drop a pin, click the **Record Location Point** button at the top of the map. For example, it's common practice to drop pins at each corner of a location. 

![](/assets/odk-geotrace-5.png)

**Automatic mode** records your location at set intervals, for example once every 20 seconds. This mode is helpful if you're recording a large area. 

The amount of time you should set for your interval depends on how you're collecting the data. For example, if you're driving, you may want to set the interval to be once every 5 seconds. If you're walking, you may want to record once every 20-30 seconds. 

If you know you need to record the corners of a large area, then you might want to try manual mode. Or, if you're using automatic mode, pause on the corner long enough for the pin to drop. Alternatively, in automatic mode, you can also use the **Record Location Point** button to manually drop a pin.

For either automatic or manual mode, keep in mind that the more points you record, the bigger your data file will be and the harder it will be to upload when you return to WiFi or you mobile network. Collect all the points you need - and only the points you need!

![](/assets/odk-geotrace-4.png)

When you're done with your GeoTrace, hit the pause button. You'll then be asked to save your information as a polyline or polygon.

If you've recording a point or line, choose polyline. If you've recording an area and created a closed shape, choose polygon.

Finally, you'll be brought to a confirmation screen where you can view your GeoTrace. 

_Note that ODK calls a geotrace a parcel regardless of what kind of location it is._

#### GeoShape {#geoshape}

GeoShape is designed for making shapes (or polygons) to represent a specific location. For example, you can use GeoShape to draw a boundary around a building or land area. 

If you're collecting data using GeoShape, you'll first be asked to zoom to your current location or to a saved feature. 

![](/assets/odk-geoshape-1.png)

In the next screen, you'll be able to start making your shape. Press the screen to place markers around your location, and notice the red lines that are created between each marker. To close your polygon, press on the same point where the polygon began.

![](/assets/odk-geoshape-2.png)

When you're ready to save your GeoShape, hit the **Save** icon on the right. If you wish to discard it, you can also hit the **Trash** button above it.

#### GeoPoint {#geopoint}

To collect single GPS coordinates, you can use GeoPoint. GeoPoint only works by tracking your specific location (drawing with your finger is not available).

When it's time to collect your GeoPoint, it will first load your location. This may take a few minutes. 

![](/assets/odk-geopoint-1.png)

Next it will give you some GPS accuracy information. Here, the accuracy is within a 24-meter radius of where the user is standing. 

![](/assets/odk-geopoint-2.png)

Once the location and accuracy information is loaded, you're ready to save your GeoPoint.

![](/assets/odk-geopoint-3.png)

###Uploading Data {#uploading-data}

When you get back to WiFi or a mobile network, you can upload your completed questionnaires to the Cadasta Platform. 

From the main menu, click **Send Finalized Form** and then check off all the forms that you want to upload (use the **Toggle All** button to select all questionnaires). Then select **Send Selected**.

![](/assets/odk-send-finalized-form.png)

Finally, you'll get a confirmation message confirming that the data has been sent. 

It's a good idea to confirm that you see the data on the Cadasta Platform. Then you can [delete any completed questionnaires](#deleting-questionnaires) from your Android device.

### Editing Data {#editing-data}

ODK makes editing your forms relatively easy. From the main menu, select **Edit Data**, then the form you want to edit. When you're done, save your changes.

### Deleting Questionnaires {#deleting-questionnaires}

You can also delete unwanted questionnaires by selecting **Delete Data** from the main menu. On the page that follows, you can toggle between Saved Forms and Blank Forms to delete either one. 

### ODK Troubleshooting {#odk-troubleshooting}

If you're having trouble using ODK, the answer to your question may be here. If not, please [contact us](http://cadasta.org/contact/) and we'll do our best to help you work through the issue.

#### Trouble Loading Your Questionnaire

##### ISSUE: I can't connect to the Cadasta server because my username and password aren't working. (And yes, I've checked to make sure they're correct!)

The easiest thing to do here is to go to the Cadasta platform and change your password. Then, return to ODK and enter your new password there.  

##### ISSUE: I'm getting a message that says to "Please wait a few moments," but it's been much much longer than that.

If the above screen is taking longer than you think it should, hit Cancel. You may be correctly connected, or you may be asked to enter your username and password again.

#### Trouble Adding Location Data

##### ISSUE: ODK won't let me add any location data. 

![](/assets/odk-trouble-1.png)

If you get the screen like the one above, unfortunately it's a known (and frustrating!) bug. Cadasta is aware that some Android devices simply refuse to log their GPS data with ODK. Our team is working to resolve the issue.

In the meantime, here are some alternatives:

1. Try using another Android device. This mysterious bug does not appear on all of them.
2. Try using GeoODK, which works very similarly to ODK. _[Learn more about how to use GeoODK with Cadasta](06-odkcollect.md)._
